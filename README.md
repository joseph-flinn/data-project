# Data Projects
This is where I am keeping my data analytics projects. 

### travel_advisory
Data Visualization: Given the US Government's travel advisory data, color the world where they 
think is dangerous for US citizens to travel.

### osmosis
Data Visualization: Given a list of reviews of the Osmosis product, creates a bar graph of the 
top 10 Universities where med students are reviewing the product.

### WIP: titanic
Machine Learning: I followed two Kaggle competition journals to get some
insight and experience with real world datasets: ["Titanic Top 4% with ensemble
modeling"](https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/titanic-top-4-with-ensemble-modeling),
["A Data Science Framework: To Achieve 99% Accuracy"](https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy). 
From here I was working on my own to create other features and apply a nueral 
network to the dataset to predict who survives. I am currently seeing very low 
results.

## Misc.
A custom docker image was used to create the plotly chart for the travel 
advisory project. The docker file is included in the docker directory.
