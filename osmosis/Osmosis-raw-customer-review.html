I love how easy it is to follow along in lectures and to take notes next to the slide, because it helps trigger my memory when I go back to review my notes. The flash cards and practice questions are a great study tool. The ability to use my classmates' flash cards and collaborate with other classmates makes studying so much more efficient. I definitely won't be going back to my old study/note taking methods. I used to create flash cards in Quizlet, which ended up being just too time consuming. With Osmosis, I can look at the correlating slide while doing practice questions without having to shuffle through several PowerPoint presentations until I find what I am looking for. Osmosis also lets you search for keywords in all of your notes at the same time which is very helpful. I used Osmosis for two weeks before taking my 2nd test this semester and it improved my grade by 15%. I am now using Osmosis full time and am excited to see my next test score.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Ana Barbosa</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Ross University</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/eu1YdKltQXCH0DD1kT_ZzLztTjCG0nFQ/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I love being able to collaborate with my classmates and using their flashcards for reviewing our lectures in addition to my own. </span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Rafael Torres</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Ross University</span></div></div></div></div><div class="ui-TestimonialBand" mixed="mixed"><div class="band-list"><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/G5Zj2xIGSPip1rf1dqXI0SmGRFuC2InC/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">As a non-traditional student, Osmosis has really helped me with streamlining my study time. I have other obligations outside of medical school, to include family and military commitments. I find that the best way to study is by creating questions and then practicing them over and over. The spaced repetition, particularly with the flash cards, also helps me in the days leading up to an exam. I utilized Anki for the first block of medical school but then decided to utilize the flashcard function in Osmosis. I find that it is more streamlined and I don't have to worry about syncing my devices. I have the Osmosis app downloaded on all my devices and use the flashcards/questions when I can't be in front of my computer.
I've been able to significantly reduce the amount of study time I put in while still maintaining great scores, particularly in Anatomy. The questions and the links to First Aid are probably the most helpful.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Mike Brisson</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/xep5G1iBQT2t7bCYTbOlQ4RvTVKJookp/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">Osmosis is great for integrative learning and cutting down time on making study products!

It helps me with my classes by solidifying information, that I would have otherwise forgotten, and it also allows me to see the material multiple times until I'm familiar with it.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Amal Benchakroun</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Ross University</span></div></div></div></div><div class="ui-TestimonialBand" mixed="mixed"><div class="band-list"><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/Jbik5ncgSyK9VdBnmP8LvMC9QEih9qJ-/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">Osmosis is a great resource that I have been using for the past year.

There are an overwhelming number of resources available to us as medical students, and it's impossible to efficiently use all of them. Osmosis lets me access multiple resources from one easy to use platform. I also love how I can upload my current coursework, and Osmosis will suggest flashcards, videos etc. to help supplement my studying; the videos that Osmosis has on Pathophysiology are really really helpful for clarifying subjects that don't get explained well in First Aid! Osmosis also makes studying flashcards much more efficient because I don't waste time reviewing cards that aren't relevant to my current coursework! I tried using Anki and I just did not want to spare the time to try and learn how to use the app; it just didn't seem reasonable that I would have to spend over 5 hours learning to comfortably use a flashcard application. What I love about Osmosis is that it suggests flashcards to me that are relevant to the coursework I'm studying RIGHT NOW.  For me this was the most appealing aspect of Osmosis because I didn't waste time reviewing cards that just weren't relevant to me yet. I also love how easy it is to make flashcards on Osmosis. I can attach flashcards to specific lecture slides, and with the easy to underline feature, I can make more than one flashcard from one flashcard entry. Lastly, the ability to study flashcards on my phone is just one more reason I like Osmosis better than the other study resources I've tried in the past. </span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Mia Wright</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">University of Arizona</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/OCGrRCzoTZCG45QYqABZe3Y_RviDHT9o/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I really ike how Osmosis presents information in a concise, visually appealing manner because it makes learning the material easier.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Geo Bolofer</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">McMaster University</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/U6HartQRTwK684SHfC7nsh_sSIaeAVN8/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I like the Osmosis videos the best, they are short and to the point.

I decided to opt for Osmosis flashcards instead of Firecracker because in addition to the great flashcards curated by the Osmosis team, a lot of them come from Brosencephalon, which I know it is a really good Anki deck that many medical students have used in the past. I also felt that the Firecracker flashcards were too detailed and the "back of the card" was really just a huge copy-past of First Aid which doesn't help at all.
Osmosis has helped me first and foremost to integrate concepts, especially through the use of hyperlinks, and realizing that the concept shows up in other organ systems.

NOW I KNOW TO REMEMBER THAT!). Second reason I love Osmosis (and this may be just due to the way Emory is set up) is that all the lecture slides are right there for me to go through; downloading every single PowerPoint really became tiresome. Thirdly, and this goes back to my first point, I love that Osmosis is a bridge between what I am expected to know for my classes versus for Step 1; this really helps with the different types of quizzes. On one hand I can take some of my classmates' quizzes that are more focused on lecture material and probably more relevant to my upcoming exams, and on the other, I can take the Step 1 related quizzes and see more what is expected for me to know in the long term. </span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Alice Haouzi</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Emory University</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I like that students can share notecards easily and that it's integrated with videos and other resources!</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Ary Dotiwala</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Louisiana State University</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I was a Firecracker user, but it was WAY too clunky, was poor at keeping track of my progress, and I did not like it's short answer format as this is not representative of USMLE.

I personally used Osmosis as my primary source of uploading lecture files and directly taking notes due to its extensive features, such as typing next to the slide? highlighting any emphasized points during lecture? circling or labelling images with the pen tool. I find this to be the best way to keep my information organized, and it proved to be very useful for when I created flashcards on the material I had learned. In addition, especially during Renal Pathology, I referred to the Osmosis videos on relevant topics because they were illustrated and narrated in such a way that the topic was broken down into much easier ?bite-sized? pieces that made digesting that information easier for me. I would highly recommend Osmosis as an organizing and learning tool and since I am personally a visual learner, I especially recommend this platform for visual learners because of the high level of interaction which stimulates active learning.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Madhura Mahapatra</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">American University of the Caribbean</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/wkIFM9DTR-qD9RTQaBg7ThCDQGiB58GZ/_.jpg"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">When I first began my medical school journey, like anyone else, I wasn?t sure how to study. Do I take notes? Make flashcards? Watch videos? Do questions? For me, the answer was yes, to all 4, and I was able to do this seamlessly using Osmosis as my study platform. I would upload the processor provided documents the night before, and take notes and make flashcards next to each page or PowerPoint slide. Each flashcard I made would, automatically, be put in my spatial learning sequence, which I was prompted everyday to complete. This allowed me to review material from days or weeks before and helped with long-term retention.

Once you upload your documents into Osmosis they scan them for keywords and attach their videos, questions, and pre-made flashcards to them. This was super helpful for topics I didn?t quite understand the first time through or topics that needed more clarification.

Osmosis makes it really easy to refer to related concepts without leaving what I'm doing, whether I'm taking notes on my lecture powerpoints, or going through flash cards. Other systems I've tried were not user friendly, and took way too long to populate my information. Consolidating flash cards, quiz questions, videos and other outside resources into one system makes Osmosis a ridiculously powerful way to study; what's so rare about it is that I can center all of those tools around my course lectures. I LOVE that I can make flashcards alongside my powerpoints, and that the card is linked to an individual slide that I can click on when reviewing. Some flashcards are pre-populated and can easily be added to my deck. I also love the idea of a group workspace in which my peers can help collaborate on making flashcards. I can't compare Osmosis to any other study resource I've used because nothing else is both comprehensive and multifaceted. It does a good job at covering a wide range of content, and of study modalities. No other study tools do such a good job at referring to and connecting other study resources. Osmosis, on the other hand, incorporates tools to populate my own information in an easy way directly from my course lectures, while suggesting supplementary information on closely related topics. </span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Jesse Matherly</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">University of Kentucky</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">Osmosis has a ton of things rolled into one program and it's incredible.

Osmosis does an excellent job of presenting the material in a way that requires students to remember what they have learned and apply it everyday so that it remains just as relevant as when they first learned it!</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Parth Gandhi</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Nova Southeastern University</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I like that Osmosis allows students to change the way they think about learning medicine.

It is really helpful for cumulative exams at the end of a course. Usually they come a few days after a formative exam and I can't dedicate as much time to studying for them as I'd like. Osmosis gives me a way to efficiently review a little bit each day to ensure I'm always on top of the material regardless of how long it's been since I learned it. I like the timeline search because it allows me to connect current material with what I've already covered! Obviously the ability to use Osmosis cards/questions and create my own as well as keeping them organized is immensely helpful. On the app, the questions that are recommended for current coursework are usually very relevant and great for review. The ability to collaborate with classmates as well as combine my own questions/cards with those provided by Osmosis is something that I haven't seen in other places.

These features help to facilitate the most complete and immersive learning experience available to medical students.I previously used Anki, but the UI was 'clunky' and the transition between devices was not as fluid as it could be. Osmosis enables the individual medical student to have access to nearly every learning feature they need, with intelligent recommendations (that aren't automatically implemented, which is nice compared to some other programs). The real strength of Osmosis is obviously in having a large, dedicated class of students who contribute to the question and flashcard bank for any given module.

1) Osmosis allows me to collaborate with my classmates and enjoy practicing active recall with the flashcards, quizzes, and questions!&nbsp;
2) I love that I can upload my lecture slides and make notes and flashcards directly from them.
3) I can even do my daily quizzes on my phone if I am away from my laptop (most often laying in bed before I go to sleep)
4) I really really LOVE the videos posted by Osmosis ( actually joined purely because of the amazing videos that I found on YouTube)
5) I enjoy the synergy with Picmonic - I use Osmosis to learn the content, and Picmonic to help remember the important bits.
6) Osmosis has made studying for medical school enjoyable again
7) Unlike Anki, creating flashcards in Osmosis is easy and not too time consuming. I also prefer writing my flashcards on Osmosis because it automatically syncs a copy of the lecture slide where I got the information wrong, in case I need to jog my memory - I don't need to search through weeks of content to find what I am looking for.
8) Osmosis has saved me time because all the information is in one place.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Nicole Carmody</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">University of Notre Dame Australia</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">I love the Osmosis videos!

Combining my flashcards and my classmates' flashcards on Osmosis, it lets us see things from another angle. What I love most about Osmosis is whenever I use the flashcards to review topics and I completely blank on a subject, I don't have to waste any time searching through my notes. I just click on the slide and I can instantly see what the lecturer said about it and what I felt was important. When a subject requires integration of concepts and you need a refresher, Osmosis really comes through. I wrote flashcards in Anki, but when subjects required large amounts of integration, I found myself having to go into my notes every other flash card. It became crazy time consuming. I'm willing to study hard to do well, but I realized using Anki was inefficient so I switched to Osmosis, and it definitely seems to be saving me time. In addition, my flashcards on Anki had no pictures because it takes forever to integrate them. With Osmosis, my flashcard will show me the slide when I'm done, which helps me with retention. After the muscle block became impossible using Anki, I started using Osmosis for my GI block of physiology. I only got a few wrong on the muscle portion of my test, but I had too many concepts that were too closely related and often times, I went back into my notes and had to remind myself a lot of what I previously learned. But after using Osmosis for the GI block, I studied less and aced my test, even though most of my classmates and I considered that to be a harder test!. Clearly, it built a better foundation for me to reason my way through the test questions, especially because it lets me to look at the slides as I study.</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Andrew Ridinger</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">Thomas Jefferson University Sidney Kimmel Medical College</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial right-align" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">While I was struggling in my classes, I heard many good reviews from friends about Osmosis.

I also like that I can separate the questions by category which allows me to focus my studying more.

Osmosis caters to your personal study schedule, which allows learning to become a much easier process. Medical school is filled with an extreme amount of information which can be overwhelming. However, Osmosis continuously helps you to review past material and learn new material in an achievable fashion. I am still a first year medical student, so I have not yet faced board exams or clinical rotations, but it has helped me tremendously in classes by creating a study workplace that relates directly to my class coursework, which I can review and learn new material from. I absolutely LOVE Osmosis and the services they provide. I wish that I joined earlier because now I cannot see myself studying without it!</span><span class="quote-right quote-mark">"</span></div><div class="student"><span data-bind="text: name" class="name">Gene Titunik Yoshikawa</span></div><div data-bind="visible:showSchool" class="school"><span data-bind="html:schoolName">University of Hawaii</span></div></div></div></div><div data-bind="css:{&quot;right-align&quot;:theme == &quot;right&quot;}" class="ui-Testimonial" mixed="mixed"><div class="wrapper"><div data-bind="visible: img" class="headshot" style="display: none;"><img data-bind="attr: { src: &quot;https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/&quot;+img}" src="https://osmose-it.s3.amazonaws.com/"></div><div class="review"><div class="quote"><span class="quote-left quote-mark">"</span><span data-bind="text: quote" class="the-quote">Osmosis offers an extensive selection of "real life" questions which I love.
