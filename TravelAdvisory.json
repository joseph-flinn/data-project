This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 2, 2018.<\/p>\n<p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html\">Travel Advisories<\/a>&nbsp;and information pages on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html\">travel.state.gov<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program<\/a>&nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate you in an emergency. The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&nbsp;<b>1 (888) 407-4747<\/b>&nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&nbsp;<b>1 (202) 501-4444<\/b>&nbsp;from other countries.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.<\/p>\n<p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants<\/li>\n<li>places of worship<\/li>\n<li>schools<\/li>\n<li>parks<\/li>\n<li>shopping malls and markets<\/li>\n<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites<\/li>\n<li>public transportation systems<\/li>\n<li>airports<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.<\/p>\n<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For further information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/\">Department of State's travel website<\/a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html\">Worldwide Caution<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html\">Travel Advisories<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html\">country information<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/travelgov\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/travelgov/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) provides several resources to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. private sector abroad.

In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.

Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict in South Sudan.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements in the city, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and must usually be conducted in groups of two or more during daylight hours. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.<\/p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

Kidnappings, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, and the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.<\/p>\n<p>A porous border with Iraq and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Israel have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.<\/p>\n<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Nusrah Front, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.<\/p>\n<p>There is an ongoing and increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012.<\/p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets against participants and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.<\/p>\n<p>There are shortages of food, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout much of Venezuela. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/health-infrastructure-breakdown-venezuela\">Level 3 ‘Avoid Nonessential Travel’<\/a> notice on May 15, 2018 due to inadequate healthcare and the breakdown of the medical infrastructure in Venezuela.<\/p>\n<p>Consular access to detained U.S. citizens who also have Venezuelan nationality is severely restricted by the Venezuelan government and the U.S. Embassy may not receive access in these cases. Security forces have arbitrarily detained U.S. citizens for long periods. Venezuelan authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy of the detention of a U.S. citizen, and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.<\/p>\n<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Venezuela.html\">country information page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Venezuela:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website for <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">Travel to High-Risk Areas<\/a>.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Do not travel between cities after dark.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Avoid travel between Simón Bolívar International Airport and Caracas at night.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Do not take unregulated taxis from Simón Bolívar International Airport, and avoid ATMs in this area.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Avoid demonstrations.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Bring a sufficient supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Enroll in the <a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program<\/a> (<a href=\"https://step.state.gov/step/\">STEP<\/a>) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Follow the Department of State on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TravelGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter<\/a>.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://www.osac.gov/Country/Venezuela/Detail\" adhocenable=\"false\">Crime and Safety Report<\/a> for Venezuela.<br>\n<\/li>\n<li>U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.
